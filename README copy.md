# **Usage**

When the webpage is loaded, the user is presented with a template for the day - with colors reflecting what is in the past, future, or present. The user is then able to select one of the blank areas and deliver their own input and save that for further retrieval. 

# **Technologies Used**

Within this website, there are components from html, css styling, as well as javascript. 

Using html, the basic website layout is dictated, and the CSS page gives style to the HTML elements. 

Using JavaScript, I was able to input many of the HTML elements like 'div' and 'button' tags. I was also able to use JavaScript to add classes to all of these elements, and these classes corresponded with the classes already predefined in CSS. 

Many elements within JavaScript were utilizied, such as a for loop and arrays.

Using BootStrap, I was able to assign classes that would help format the page.

Using jQuery, I was able to select and effect elements that were already defined within the HTML file.
